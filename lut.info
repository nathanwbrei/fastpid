Description of PID LUT's columns:

1) PDG code of the particle
2) charge
3) momentum, bins = {0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85,
                     0.9, 0.95, 1,   1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2,   2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3,   4,    5,   6} [GeV/c]
		     for higher momenta one should use 6 GeV/c
4) polar angle, [25-160] degree with 1 degree step
5) azimuthal angle [0-30] with 0.5 degree step, there is 12x azimuthal symmetry. 
6) probability for electron
7) probability for pion
8) probability for kaon
9) probability for proton

Probabilities are normalized to 1.
If all probabilities = 0 then PID is not possible.
