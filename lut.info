Description of PID LUT's columns:

1) PDG code of the particle
2) charge
3) momentum
4) polar angle
5) azimuthal angle
6) probability for electron
7) probability for pion
8) probability for kaon
9) probability for proton

Probabilities are normalized to 1.
If all probabilities = 0 then PID is not possible.
